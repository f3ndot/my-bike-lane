A Word on Funding
----------------------

I know it's a silly project, but it does cost me money to run. If you have enjoyed using the site please consider buying me a cup of coffee.

If you'd rather feel warm and fuzzy inside, I'm also fundraising for the [Ride to Conquer Cancer 2013](http://www.conquercancer.ca/goto/justinbull) event:
